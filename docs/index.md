  - title: What is Echologator?
    details: UF Open Source Club's Echologator is a messaging app that allows users to anonymously talk to people within their area, say, inside of a large building or a section of town. Our aim is to get our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for our project done during Spring 2024.
  - title: How can I contribute?
    details: Click the blue Get Started button above if you would like to to start contributing to our project. Bonus points if you skim through our code on GitHub or talk with a tech lead, so you can get up to speed. For more information, go to the contact page.
  - title: Wait, I thought this project was called...
    details: In the past, Echologator has also been called Promixity Chat, Earshot, and some other names. We're trying to come up with a better name that isn't UF-specific, so please let us know your ideas, if you have one.
