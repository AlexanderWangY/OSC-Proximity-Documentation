# Getting Started

## Preface

Depending on what operating system (Linux, Windows, etc.) you are running, your setup instructions will be slightly different. While using Linux is highly encouraged, it is not at all a requirement to work on this project. 
:::warning
Even if you only want to work on either the frontend or the backend portion of this project, please keep in mind that both portions will need to be configured.
:::
:::info
If you are using Windows and would like to try using a terminal inside of Linux without creating a virtual machine, you might want to look into installing [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

We are excited to have you! :hugs:

### Some definitions

As a quick note, the **frontend** of our project is the React Native app we're developing, which individual **clients** (or users) will use. We may sometimes refer to this as the client-side portion of our app.
The **backend** (sometimes referred to as the **server**) is what our frontend app uses to communicate to our database. It allows the creation, retrieval, and searching of data to be done via HTTP requests, as well as some other means you will learn about later.

## Prerequisites

Although you do not need any prior experience to contribute to this open source project, a bit of experience with web development would help you **greatly** in contributing and understanding the code.

Here are some recommended simple tutorials to get you caught up:

- **HTML/CSS:** [HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc)
- **Javascript:** [JavaScript Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfAl9bwzVZk)
- **ExpressJS:** [ExpressJS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39znK--Yo1o&list=PL_cUvD4qzbkwp6pxx27pqgohrsP8v1Wj2&index=1)
- **React Native** [React Native Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obH0Po_RdWk&t=2904s)

::: tip
You only need a basic understanding. Don't be afraid to ask teammates to help you understand the code better!
:::

However, the best way to learn (in Wang's experience) is to always read the code and ask questions. Contact a tech lead if you are having trouble, and we will be more than glad to help you learn the tech stack!

### Prerequisites

First, ensure you have a stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system (LTS or Long Term Release versions are preferred). If you use a package manager, check its wiki for any extra installation instructions.

:::tip
If you run into problems running Node.js, you may want to install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) as an alternative. Setting this up can be slightly more in-depth, but it is another option.

### Branching and Cloning the Repository

When contributing to this project, make sure to [commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) changes into your personal repository that is [forked](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) from the main one.

Travel to our [Github repository](https://github.com/ufosc/OSC-Proximity-Chat-App) and create a new fork into your personal repositories.

:::tip
Make sure to give our repo a star too! :star: :star: :star:
:::

![Guide1](/imgs/docimg1.png)

Then, copy your new forked repository's clone address and return to your terminal/bash.

![Guide2](/imgs/docimg2.png)

In your terminal/bash, navigate to a folder/location you would like your repository to be in.

Then clone your repository and enter the directory it creates:

```bash
$ git clone <paste your repository's address>
$ cd <the newly created directory>
```

## Setting up Firebase (Database)

Before we install the dependancies and run our client and server projects, we need to set up our database. For this part, we have chosen to use Google's Firebase to store our user information and messages. Our backend neatly allows us to search and send database information using a file format that is easy to read and parse called [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

1) Log into a Google account you wish to host the Firebase on.
2) Go to the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) website.
3) Click "Add a project" on the dashboard.
4) Choose whatever project name you see fit. Call it ProximityChatEchologatorEarshot if you're low on ideas (like us).
5) Disable Google Analytics when asked, and then create the project
6) After the project is done being created, click the settings icon and the "Project settings".
7) Underneath the "Your apps" section, click the Web Development option (Looks like `</>`).
8) Type in a name for your app (at your discretion), keep "Firebase Hosting" unchecked and click "Register App".
9) Before continuing, navigate into the `/server` directory and locate `config_example.md`. **Copy** the file into a new one named `.env`.
:::warning
Do not delete `config_example.md`. Again, don't remove this config example either for the sake of others!!!
:::
10) On Firebase, now copy the codes below (not actually the ones below, the ones for your Firebase):
![Firebase1](/imgs/firebase1.png)

And then format them into the `.env` file like this (no need for quotation marks):

![Firebase2](/imgs/firebase2.png)

10) Continue to the Firebase console and navigate to Build > Firestore Database on the sidebar, and click create database. Expand the sidebar if you don't see these titles.
11) Select the nam5 server and continue.
12) Start in test mode and click enable.

### Setting up Firebase Authentication
14) From the project root directory, navigate to `/client`. Copy `config_example.md` into a file named `.env`, just like what we did in `/server`. Then, copy the same codes from the previous section into the `.env` file. Your `.env` file should look like this:
:::warning
Do not delete `config_example.md`. Again, don't remove this config example either for the sake of others!!!
:::
![Fireauth1](/imgs/authenv.png)

:::info
The frontend `.env` looks different because the dotenv package is not available for React Native. Instead, we use react-native-dotenv.
:::
15) Navigate to the Firebase console and click on the Authentication tab on the left sidebar. Then, click on the "Set up sign-in method" button.
16) Click on the "Email/Password" option and enable it.

Now we are all done setting up our database!!

### Installing Dependencies

### Frontend

Navigate into the `client` folder and install the required dependencies using Node.js:

```bash
$ cd client
$ npm install
```
:::info
After running `npm install` you will likely get a warning that vulnerabilities were found. This warning can be safely ignored and auditing vulnerable packages is not necessary.
:::

Perfect :thumbsup:!

Now we need to configure your environment variables for API calls to the backend server.

Open the `.env` which you created earlier.  Append your machine's [local (not public or global) IPv4 address](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address) after the equals sign without quotes. Leave the port the same unless directed.
:::warning
Again, do not delete `config_example.md`. If you delete it, then on the next time your commit is merged it will be gone for everyone else. :(
:::

Your `config_example.md` should now have something like this:

```config_example.md
EXPO_PUBLIC_LOCALHOST_ADDRESS = <YOUR IPv4 ADDRESS>
```

Run `npm start` to create a local running test of the mobile app.

```bash
$ npm start
```

You should see a few different things load as well as a QR code, which you can scan with your phone to test the app. To use this, you will need to install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/expo-go), but after that development will now be between your computer and your phone.

You are now done setting up the front end for development!
:tada: :tada: :tada: :tada:


### Backend

From the project root directory, navigate to the `server` folder and install the dependencies.

```bash
$ cd server
$ npm install
```

::: warning
Running `npm install` to set up frontend does **_not_** mean that the dependencies are also installed for the backend!
:::

Navigate into the `src` directory. This is your working directory.

```bash
$ cd src
```

#### Running the backend server

Since we are writing in TypeScript that will need to be compiled into JavaScript, periodically run `npx tsc` in a second terminal during development. Additionally, `npx tsc -w` will do this much more quickly and recompile on file changes.

To start the server, run `npm start`.

For example:

```bash
$ npx tsc && npm start
```

:::info
The package [Nodemon]() is very useful for restarting the server on file changes.
If you would like to use it, install it with `npm i -g nodemon`. Then you can run it in a separate terminal using the `nodemon` command.
