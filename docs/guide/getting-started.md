# Getting Started

## Preface

Depending on what operating system (Linux, Windows, etc.) you are running, your setup instructions will be slightly different. While using Linux is highly encouraged, it is not at all a requirement to work on this project.
:::warning
Even if you only want to work on either the frontend or the backend portion of this project, please keep in mind that both portions will need to be configured.
:::
:::info
If you are using Windows and would like to try using a terminal inside of Linux without creating a virtual machine, you might want to look into installing [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
:::

We are excited to have you! :hugs:

### Some definitions

As a quick note, the **frontend** of our project is the React Native app we're developing, which individual **clients** (or users) will use. We may sometimes refer to this as the client-side portion of our app.
The **backend** (sometimes referred to as the **server**) is what our frontend app uses to communicate to our database. It allows the creation, retrieval, and searching of data to be done via HTTP requests, as well as some other means you will learn about later.

## Prerequisites

Although you do not need any prior experience to contribute to this open source project, a bit of experience with web development would help you **greatly** in contributing and understanding the code.

Here are some recommended simple tutorials to get you caught up:

- **HTML/CSS:** [HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc)
- **Javascript:** [JavaScript Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfAl9bwzVZk)
- **ExpressJS:** [ExpressJS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39znK--Yo1o&list=PL_cUvD4qzbkwp6pxx27pqgohrsP8v1Wj2&index=1)
- **React Native** [React Native Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obH0Po_RdWk&t=2904s)

::: tip
You only need a basic understanding. Don't be afraid to ask teammates to help you understand the code better!
:::

However, the best way to learn (in Wang's experience) is to always read the code and ask questions. Contact a tech lead if you are having trouble, and we will be more than glad to help you learn the tech stack!

### Prerequisites

First, ensure you have a stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system (LTS or Long Term Release versions are preferred). If you use a package manager, check its wiki for any extra installation instructions.

:::tip
If you run into problems running Node.js, you may want to install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) as an alternative. Setting this up can be slightly more in-depth, but it is another option.

### Branching and Cloning the Repository

When contributing to this project, make sure to [commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) changes into your personal repository that is [forked](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) from the main one.

Travel to our [Github repository](https://github.com/ufosc/OSC-Proximity-Chat-App) and create a new fork into your personal repositories.

:::tip
Make sure to give our repo a star too! :star: :star: :star:
:::

![Guide1](/imgs/docimg1.png)

Then, copy your new forked repository's clone address and return to your terminal/bash.

![Guide2](/imgs/docimg2.png)

In your terminal/bash, navigate to a folder/location you would like your repository to be in.

Then clone your repository and enter the directory it creates:

```bash
$ git clone <paste your repository's address>
$ cd <the newly created directory>
```

## Setting up Firebase

Before we install the dependancies and run our client and server projects, we need to set up our database. For this part, we have chosen to use Google's Firebase to store our user information and messages. Our backend neatly allows us to search and send database information using a file format that is easy to read and parse called [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

1. Log into a Google account you wish to host the Firebase on.
2. Go to the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) website.
3. Click "Add a project" on the dashboard.
4. Choose whatever project name you see fit. Call it ProximityChatEchologatorEarshot if you're low on ideas (like us).
5. Disable Google Analytics when asked, and then create the project
6. After the project is done being created, click the settings icon and the "Project settings".
7. Underneath the "Your apps" section, click the Web Development option (Looks like `</>`).
8. Type in a name for your app (at your discretion), keep "Firebase Hosting" unchecked and click "Register App".

### Setting up Firebase Database

Make sure you have already completed the previous steps in setting up firebase.

In order to allow our backend to access firebase's database and set everything up, we need to activate Firebase's Firestore Database.

1. Navigate to the Firestore Database tab on the left hand side of the Firebase console.
2. Click get started and select `nam5` as the server. Then continue.
3. Select start in `test mode`.
4. Now, navigate back to the console screen. Select the **cog** wheel at the top left side. Next to `Project Overview`. Click `Project Settings`.
5. Navigate to the `Service Accounts` tab.
6. Click `Generate a new private key`. And then `Generate key`
7. It should start a download for a `json` file. Rename it `firebase-secrets.json` and save into the `/server` folder in the project directory.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Make sure to also copy the contents of `/server/config_example.md` into a file called `.env` inside `/server/` that you make yourself! DON'T DELETE `config_example.md`
:::

After you complete these steps, your backend should now be able to access your database and also authorize JWT tokens from the client.

### Setting up Firebase Authentication

We also need to use Firebase's web modular API to handle authentication on the client side (the mobile app).

1. In your `./client` folder you should see a file called `config_example.md`. Copy the contents of that file into a file you make called `.env` inside the `./client` directory.
2. From your firebase project's main console, navigate to the **cog** on the top left next to `Project Overview`. Select `Project Settings`.
3. Navigate to the `General` tab (should be the default tab) and scroll down until you see app keys. Should look something like this:

![Fireauthkeys](/imgs/firebasekeys.png)

4. Copy those keys (without the quotation marks) into their respective variables in the `.env` file you just created. After you are done it should look something like this:

![Fireauth1](/imgs/authenv.png)

:::warning
Do not delete `config_example.md`.
:::

4.  Navigate to the Firebase console and click on the Authentication tab on the left sidebar. Then, click on the "Set up sign-in method" button.
5.  Click on the "Email/Password" option and enable it.

Now we are all done setting up our database!!

## Installing Dependencies

### Frontend

Navigate into the `client` folder and install the required dependencies using Node.js:

```bash
$ cd client
$ npm install
```

:::info
After running `npm install` you will likely get a warning that vulnerabilities were found. This warning can be safely ignored and auditing vulnerable packages is not necessary.
:::

Perfect :thumbsup:!

Now, run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

It should bundle the app and show you a QR code. Above the QR code there should be an ip that looks like `http://xx.xx.xxx.xx:8080` or something similar. Copy the IP (not the :8000 or the http://) and paste the into `EXPO_IP` in your `.env` file. You will have to do this step everytime you launch between coding sessions (think 3-4 hours without coding).

Download the Expo Go app to your phone and scan the QR code. Then it should run in your testing environment (your phone).
:::info
If you scan the QR code and it says "no usable data found" you probably don't have the app installed yet.
:::
You are now done setting up the front end for development!
:tada: :tada: :tada: :tada:

### Backend

From the project root directory, navigate to the `server` folder and install the dependencies.

```bash
$ cd server
$ npm install
```

::: warning
Running `npm install` to set up frontend does **_not_** mean that the dependencies are also installed for the backend!
:::

Navigate into the `src` directory. This is your working directory.

```bash
$ cd src
```

#### Running the backend server

Since we are writing in TypeScript that will need to be compiled into JavaScript, periodically run `npx tsc` in a second terminal during development. Additionally, `npx tsc -w` will do this much more quickly and recompile on file changes.

To start the server, run `npm start`.

For example:

```bash
$ npx tsc && npm start
```

:::info
The package [Nodemon]() is very useful for restarting the server on file changes.
If you would like to use it, install it with `npm i -g nodemon`. Then you can run it in a separate terminal using the `nodemon` command.
