# Frequently Asked Questions

- ### **Are there any prerequisites before working on this project?**

No, there are no prerequisites. This project is open to anyone who is willing to learn and contribute. **However,** our backend issues tend to be more complex and require a bit more experience. If you are new to programming (or to web/mobile development), we recommend starting with the frontend.

- ### **I don't know what to work on!**

No worries! We regulary update our [issues](https://github.com/ufosc/OSC-Proximity-Chat-App/issues) page with new tasks. Comment on an issue if you are interested in working on it. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to a tech lead.

- ### **When will the app be done?**

While we are aimed at the MVP being done by the end of Spring 2024 semester, we are always looking to improve and add new features. The sooner **YOU** join, the sooner we can get there!
