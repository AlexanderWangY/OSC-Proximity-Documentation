# Websocket Implementation

:::danger
This portion of the project is in the very early stages of development. As work continues, this page will become updated.
:::

Websockets are used to enable real-time messaging through a constant connection between a client and our server. While Node.js has a native WebSocket implementation, we've opted to use Socket.io since it simplifies a lot of our work.

:::info
As WebSockets are needed for both portions of our project, a client implementation of socket.io is used in the front end. See the frontend WebSocket documentation for more information (when it becomes available).
