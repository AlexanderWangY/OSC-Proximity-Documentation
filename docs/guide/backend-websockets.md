# Websocket Implementation

:::danger
This portion of project is in the very early stages of development. As work continues, this page will become updated.
:::

Websockets are used to enable realtime messaging through a constant connection between a client and our server. While Node.js has a native websocket implementation, we've opted to use Socket.io since it simplifies a lot of our work.

:::info
As websockets are needed for both portions of our project, a client implementation of socket.io is used in the frontend. See the frontend websocket documentation for more information (when it becomes available).
