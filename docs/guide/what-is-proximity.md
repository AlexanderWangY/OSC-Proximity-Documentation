# What is OSC Proximity Chat

OSC (Open Source Club's) Proximity Chat App is a *in development* mobile social networking app. The app aims to allow easy communication between users within a certain distance between each other. Our app singles your experience down to only a few hundred meters from you. That means everything and anything you see or post is relevant to your current location.

## Our Plans

We started the planning and development of OSC Proximity Chat around September 2023. The **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product) is scheduled to be completed Spring semester 2024. If you are interested in learning more about the app and/or contributing, please [contact us](/contact)!
