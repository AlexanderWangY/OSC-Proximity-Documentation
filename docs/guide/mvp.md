# Future ideas

These aren't our first priority, but could be if we complete our MVP. If you have feature suggestions, they might become one of these.

- Pings
    - Users can open a map. There will be pings placed throughout the map with an attatched message, which a user must walk to in order to read.
    - More than one user can add a message to any ping.
    - Pings will contain an expiration time.
- Shadowbanning for moderation
- GIF picker and support for messages containing images
    - Do not allow uploading of personal images
    - Could work with a website such as Giphy
- Color themes
- Replies to messages
